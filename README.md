# Welcome to transcribr
# A Transcription Deconstructor for Zoom transcripts 

This simple, and mildly sketchily code, tool cleans up a Zoom transcript for you by doing the following:

* Remove timestamps
* Remove blank lines
* Remove any HTML or coded content
* Remove line numbers

## How to Use Transcribr

All you need to do is name your source file source.vtt in the same folder as the transcribr.rb file and then run:

```
ruby transcribr.rb
```

## Why is it spelled Transcribr?

This is a throwback to when every startup was just a regular word with a vowel removed.  

## Why is this coded so poorly?

I'm not a developer.  Wish I was better at this stuff.  This does what I need it to.
